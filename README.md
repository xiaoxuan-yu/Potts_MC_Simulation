# Random Simulation Method Computer Project 1
The repository contains the code for the first computer project of the course Random Simulation Method at Peking University, 2023. The project is about the simulation of the 2D Potts model. The code is written in Python with `numpy,numba`. The code and report is written by [Xiaoxuan Yu](https://github.com/xiaoxuan-yu).
